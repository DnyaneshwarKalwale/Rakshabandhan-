          As we celebrate this Raksha Bandhan, I wish all my sisters, like Anjali, Guddiya, Aasha, and many more, nothing but happiness, success, and fulfillment in everything you do. Being your big brother, I feel the responsibility to be strong enough to protect all of you. But as your big brother, I also advise you to be brave and learn to protect yourselves. I have full confidence that you all can do that. I’m not saying I won’t be there—I will always be there for you all. Keep moving forward, achieve great things in life, and whenever you feel like looking back or want to give up, I’ll always be there to help, protect, and push you forward to achieve your goals.
          May you continue to shine brightly, and may our bond grow stronger with each passing day. 
          Thank you for being the incredible sister you are, and for filling my life with so much love and joy. Happy Raksha Bandhan, dear sister!🌸🌸🌸

          Raksha Bandhan is a day that fills my heart with warmth and nostalgia. I find myself reminiscing about the countless moments we've shared, each one contributing to the unbreakable bond we have today. From the early days of our sibling rivalry to the deep friendship we've built over the years, every memory with you is a treasure I hold dear. 
          You’ve always been there, not just as a sister, but as someone who understands me in ways no one else can.
        </p>
        <p>
          I just remembered something from when we were little kids. I was the youngest, and Mommy and Papa only celebrated my birthday. You and Prm would cry and smile mischievously like little troublemakers. We used to fight over watching TV, and when you got angry, you would say some not-so-nice words. Then I would get angry and try to hit you, and Mom would come and scold me. You would cry because I hit you, and I would cry because Mom scolded me, while Prm always got away unscathed.

          When I moved to Pune to complete my engineering, I realized how much I missed you all.💖💖
        </p>
        <p>
           It's comforting to know that no matter what challenges life throws our way, we’ll face them together, just as we always have.

          On this Raksha Bandhan, I want to express just how much you mean to me. You are more than just a sister; you all are my best friends, my advisor. I couldn’t imagine my life without you all in it. As we tie the rakhi this year,
           I pray that our bond continues to grow stronger and that you are blessed with all the happiness in the world. Happy Raksha Bandhan!
        </p>
        
        <p>You are My Everything SISTER's 💖.</p>
